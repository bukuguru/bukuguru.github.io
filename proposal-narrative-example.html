                        Contohnya :<br /><br />The Ugly Duckling<br />oleh Hans Cristian Andersen<br /><br />One upon time, a mother duck sat on her eggs. She felt tired of sitting on them. She just wished the eggs would break out.<br /><br />Several days later, she got her wish. The eggs cracked and some cute little ducklings appeared. "Peep, peep" the little ducklings cried. "Quack, quack" their mother greeted in return.<br /><br />However the largest egg had not cracked. The mother duck sat on it for several days. Finally, it cracked and a huge ugly duckling waddled out. The mother duck looked at him in surprise. He was so big and very gray. He didn't look like the others at all. He was like a turkey.<br /><br />When the mother duck brought the children to the pond for their first swimming lesson., the huge grey duckling splashed and paddled about just as nicely as the other ducklings did. "That is not a turkey chick. He is my very own son and quite handsome" the mother said proudly.<br /><br />However, the other animals didn't agree. They hissed and made fun of him day by day. Even his own sisters and brothers were very unkind. "You are very ugly" they quacked.<br /><br />The little poor duckling was very unhappy. "I wish I looked like them" he thought to himself. One day, the ugly duckling run away and hid in the bushes. The sad duckling lived alone through the cold and snow winter. Finally the spring flowers began to bloom. While he was swimming in the pond, he saw three large white swans swimming toward him. "Oh, dear. these beautiful birds will laugh and peck me too" he said to himself. But the swans did not attack him. Instead, they swam around him and stroked him with their bills. As the ugly duckling bent his neck to speak to them, he saw his reflection in the water. He could not believe his eyes. "I am not an ugly duckling but a beautiful swam" he exclaimed.<br /><br />He was very happy. From that day on, he swam and played with his new friends and was happier than he had never been.<br />

One day, a young traveler arrived in the kingdom.He was called Ajisaka. 
Ajisaka took shelter in the house of a widow who quickly came to look 
upon the young man as her own son. When he heard of the king's strange 
appetite, Ajisaka sympathized with the villagers' plight and immediately
 volunteered to become the king's next meal.<br />
Ajisaka went directly to the king's palace.“I am willing to be your next
 meal. Your Highnees. However, I have a request.“ said Aji Saka to the 
king. “Whatever you please, young man, I will grant your request,“ the 
king replied. “Before you eat me, grant me some land. Just enough length
 of my own headcloth.“ continued Aji Saka. “Come, Young Man. Let's 
measure your headcloth so that I can have my meal and you can have your 
land“ agreed the king.<br />
Ajisaka began to unwrap the cloth tied around his head. The king got 
down from his throne and hold one end of the headcloth. He stepped 
backward. What he didn't know was that this headcloth was much longer. 
The king kept going backward, step by step, as the cloth kept 
unraveling. He stepped backward through the palace square, backward 
across the village, holding the end of Ajisaka's headcloth. The king 
kept stepping backward until reached the sea cliftts of the sea.<br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>1.True Friends</p><p></p><p>    Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.</p><p>     Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree.

'You should teach me some of yours!'</p><p>    'Well, maybe some day, when I have the time, I may teach you a few of the simpler ones,' replied the fox airily.</p><p>   Just then they heard the barking of a pack of dogs in the distance. The barking grew louder and louder - the dogs were coming in their direction! At once the cat ran to the nearest tree and climbed into its branches, well out of reach of any dog. 'This is the trick I told you about, the only one I know,' said the cat. 'Which one of your hundred tricks are you going to use?'</p><p>    The fox sat silently under the tree, wondering which trick she should use. Before she could make up her mind, the dogs arrived.

</p><p>On a hot day of summer, an ant was searching for some water. After walking around for some time, she came near the river. To drink the water, she climbed up on a small rock. While trying to drink a water, she slipped and fell into the river
</p><p>There was a dove sitting on a branch of a tree who saw an ant falling into the river. The dove quickly plucked a leaf and dropped it into the river near the struggling ant. The ant moved towards the leaf and climbed up onto it. Soon, the leaf drifted to dry ground, and the ant jumped out. She looked up to the tree and thanked the dove.
</p><p>Later, the same day, a bird catcher nearby was about to throw his net over the dove hoping to trap it. An ant saw him and guessed what he was about to do. The dove was resting and he had no idea about the bird catcher. An ant quickly bit him on the foot. Feeling the pain, the bird catcher dropped his net and let out a light scream. The dove noticed it and quickly flew away.

                        <strong>Queen of Arabia and Three Sheiks</strong><br />Maura, who like to be thought of as the most beautiful and powerful queen of Arabia, had many suitors. One by one she discarded them, until her list was reduced to just three sheiks. The three sheiks were all equally young and handsome. They were also rich and strong. It was very hard to decide who would be the best of them.<br />One evening, Maura disguised herself and went to the camp of the three sheiks. As they were about to have dinner, Maura asked them for something to eat. The first gave her some left over food. The second Sheik gave her some unappetizing camel’s tail. The third sheik, who was called Hakim, offered her some of the most tender and tasty meat. After dinner, the disguised queen left the sheik’s camp.<br />The following day, the queen invited the three sheiks to dinner at her palace. She ordered her servant to give each one exactly what they had given her the evening before. Hakim, who received a plate of delicious meat, refused to eat it if the other two sheiks could not share it with him.<br />This Sheik Hakim’s act finally convinced Queen Maura that he was the man for her. “Without question, Hakim is the most generous of you” she announced her choice to the sheiks. “So it is Hakim I will marry”.<br /><br />sumber : http://www.belajarbahasainggris.us/2014/01/5-contoh-singkat-narrative-text.htmlAladdin, snow white, kebo iwo .

                        Narrative Text<p></p><p><strong>Malin Kundang</strong></p><p>A long time ago, in a small village near the beach in West Sumatra lived a woman and her son, Malin Kundang. Malin Kundang and his mother had to live hard because his father had passed away when he was a baby. Malin Kundang was a healthy, dilligent, and strong boy. He usually went to sea to catch fish. After getting fish he would bring it to his mother, or sell the caught fish in the town.</p><p></p><p>One day, when Malin Kundang was sailing, he saw a merchant’s ship being raided by a band of pirates. With his bravery, Malin Kundang helped the merchant defeat the pirates. To thank him, the merchant allowed Malin Kundang to sail with him. Malin Kundang agreed in the hope to get a better life. He left his mother alone. </p><p></p><p>Many years later, Malin Kundang became wealthy. He had a huge ship and a lot of crews who worked loading trading goods. He was also married to a beautiful woman. When he was sailing on his trading journey, his ship landed on a coast near a small village. The local people recognized that it was Malin Kundang, a boy from the area. The news ran fast in the town; “Malin Kundang has become rich and now he is here”. An old woman, who was Malin Kundang’s mother, ran to the beach to meet the new rich merchant. She wanted to hug him to release her sadness of being lonely after a long time. When his mother came near him, Malin Kundang who was with his beautiful wife and his ship crews denied that she was his mother. She had pleaded Malin Kundang to look at her and admit that she was her mother. But he kept refusing to do it and yelling at her. At last Malin Kundang said to her “Enough, old woman! I have never had a mother like you, a dirty and ugly woman!” After that he ordered his crews to set sail to leave the old woman who was then full of sadness and anger. </p><p></p><p>Finally, feeling enraged, she cursed Malin Kundang that he would turn into a stone if he didn’t apologize to her. Malin Kundang just laughed and set sail. Suddenly a thunderstorm came in the quiet sea, wrecking his huge ship. He was thrown out to a small island. It was really too late for him to avoid his curse; he had turned into a stone.</p><p></p><p>Contoh teks narasi lainnya bisa dilihat di link berikut:</p><p><strong>Legend of Pesut Mahakam </strong>https://brainly.co.id/tugas/21092940</p><p><strong>The Clever Turtle and The Foolish Hunters </strong>https://brainly.co.id/tugas/21656221</p><p></p>Pembahasan<p><strong>Narrative text adalah jenis bacaan yang berupa cerita khayalan, kisah nyata yang direkayasa, atau dongeng.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Struktur narrative text:</strong></p><strong>Orientation </strong>(pendahuluan) <strong>-</strong> pada bagian ini biasanya diceritakan awal mula dan perkenalan tokoh-tokohnya beserta tempat dan waktu kejadian.<strong>Complication -</strong> bagian ini menceritakan tentang ketika permasalahan antar tokoh karakter muncul.<strong>Resolution - </strong>bagaimana penyelesaian masalah pada bagian complication diatasi di bagian ini.<strong>Re-orientation</strong> (optional)  <strong>-</strong> adalah rangkuman dan penutup dari cerita narasi.<p></p><p><strong>Tujuan: </strong>Untuk menghibur para pembaca.</p><p></p>Pelajari lebih lanjut soal-soal yang berhubungan tentang narrative text:<p>brainly.co.id/tugas/21092940</p><p>brainly.co.id/tugas/21275567</p>___________________________Detil Jawaban<p><strong>Kelas : </strong>SMA kelas X</p><p><strong>Mapel : </strong>Bahasa Inggris</p><p><strong>Kategori : </strong>Narrative, Past perfect tense</p><p><strong>Kata kunci : </strong>Folktale</p><p><strong>Kode : </strong>10.5.14</p><br />

"Peep, peep" the little ducklings cried. "Quack, quack" their mother greeted in return.</p><p></p><p>However the largest egg had not cracked. The mother duck sat on it for several days. Finally, it cracked and a huge ugly duckling waddled out. The mother duck looked at him in surprise. He was so big and very gray. He didn't look like the others at all. He was like a turkey.</p><p></p><p>When the mother duck brought the children to the pond for their first swimming lesson., the huge grey duckling splashed and paddled about just as nicely as the other ducklings did. "That is not a turkey chick. He is my very own son and quite handsome" the mother said proudly.</p><p></p><p>However, the other animals didn't agree. They hissed and made fun of him day by day. Even his own sisters and brothers were very unkind. "You are very ugly" they quacked.</p><p></p><p>The little poor duckling was very unhappy. "I wish I looked like them" he thought to himself. One day, the ugly duckling run away and hid in the bushes. The sad duckling lived alone through the cold and snow winter. Finally the spring flowers began to bloom. While he was swimming in the pond, he saw three large white swans swimming toward him. "Oh, dear. these beautiful birds will laugh and peck me too" he said to himself. But the swans did not attack him. Instead, they swam around him and stroked him with their bills. As the ugly duckling bent his neck to speak to them, he saw his reflection in the water. He could not believe his eyes. "I am not an ugly duckling but a beautiful swam" he exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>He was very happy. From that day on, he swam and played with his new friends and was happier than he had never been.</p><br />

He was thirsty so he wanted to drink on the river.</p><p>    When the mouse deer came next to the rive, a tiger approached him and wanted to eat him. Of course the mouse deer tried to escape, but the tiger run faster and caught him.</p><p>      In that dangerous situation the mouse deer thought hard how to escape the tiger. Then he got idea and said to the tiger, “Listen! Your mightiness and toughness are all great! But I have my own king. He has a greater strength than yours! I am sure that nobody can match his powers!” Because the tiger felt taunted, he declared that he would challenge the mouse deer’s king.</p><p>     Next the mouse lead the tiger to the river, and said, “Now Look at the water. You will see my king” Foolishly the tiger looked in the river and surely saw another tiger in the water. Then he growled, but the tiger in the river imitated to growl too. Because of his too high self pride, the tiger jumped into the water, and wanted to fight. He was believing there was another tiger in the water.</p><p>     The mouse deer took that opportunity to escape. After fighting with himself in the river, the tiger realized that he was fooled by the mouse deer.</p><p>Terjemahan:</p><p>              Kancil dan Harimau</p><p>     Pada suatu hari, terdapat seekor kancil. Ia merasa haus serta ingin minum air di dalam sungai.</p><p>     Pada waktu si kancil sampai di pinggir sungai, ada seekor harimau yang mendekat dan ingin memakannya. Tentu saja kancil mencoba untuk melarikan diri, tetapi si harimau berlari lebih cepat serta berhasil menangkapnya.</p><p>     Dalam kondisi yang berbahaya, kancil kemudian berpikir keras bagaimana caranya untuk bisa melepaskan diri dari harimau itu. Kemudian ia memperoleh ide bagus dan langsung berkata kepada harimau, “Dengar! Binatang yang tangguh dan besar! Namun saya memiliki raja sendiri. Dia mempunyai kekuatan yang lebih besar dari Kamu! Saya yakin tidak ada yang dapat menandingi kekuatannya!” Sebab si harimau merasa terhina, ia menyatakan jika ia akan segera menantang raja si kancil.</p><p>     Si kancil lalu mengajak harimau untuk pergi ke sungai, dan berkata, “Sekarang lihat kedalam air tersebut. Kamu akan segera melihat raja saya” Bodohnya harimau tersebut, melihat bayangan seekor harimau lain. Kemudian ia menggeram, serta harimau yang terlihat di sungai pun ikut mengeram. Sebab keangkuhannya, harimau tersebut kemudian melompat ke dalam air untuk melawan. Ia yakin jika ada harimau lain di dalam air sungai tersebut.</p><p>     Kancil pun mengambil kesempatan tersebut untuk segera melarikan diri. Selepas bertarung dengan bayangannya sendiri di dalam sungai, harimau tersebut baru menyadari jika ia tertipu oleh si kancil.</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p> # semoga membantu #</p><br />

After walking around for a moment, she came to a spring. To reach the spring, she had to climb up a blade of grass. While making her way up, she slipped and fell unintentionally into the water.  </p><p>She could have sunk if a dove up a nearby tree had not seen her. Seeing that the ant was in trouble, the dove quickly put off a leaf from a tree and dropped it immediately into the water near the struggling ant. Then the ant moved towards the leaf and climbed up there. Soon it carried her safely to dry ground.  </p><p>Not long after at that, there was a hunter nearby who was throwing out his net towards the dove, hoping to trap it in this way.  </p><p>Guessing what he should do, the ant quickly bit him on the heel. Feeling the pain, the hunter dropped his net and the dove flew away quickly from this net.

Taking a few steps backward, the fox jumped but unfortunately he missed the hanging grapes. Again the fox took a few paces backward, ran, and tried to reach them but he still failed.  </p><p>Finally, giving up, the fox turned up his nose and said, “They’re probably sour anyway,” and proceeded to walk away.  </p><p></p><p><strong>                                                    True Friends</strong></p><p>Once upon a time, there were two close friends who were walking through the forest together. They knew that anything dangerous can happen any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would always be together in any case of danger.  </p><p>Suddenly, they saw a large bear getting closer toward them. One of them climbed a nearby tree at once. But unfortunately the other one did not know how to climb up the tree. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless and pretended to be a dead man.  </p><p>The bear came near the one who was lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place because the bears do not want to touch the dead creatures. After that, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend that was on the ground, “Friend, what did the bear whisper into your ears?” The other friend replied, “Just now the bear advised me not to believe a false friend”.</p><p></p><br />
